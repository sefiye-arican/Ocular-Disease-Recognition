# ðŸ©º Multi-Disease Detection from Fundus Images Using an Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Model

This project is an **attention-enhanced deep learning-based** diagnostic system that enables the **simultaneous detection of multiple eye diseases from fundus images**.\
In this study, **CLAHE** and **ESRGAN** techniques were used to improve image quality, and **Channel & Spatial Attention** mechanisms were integrated into transfer learning models to enhance performance.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Automatic detection of **glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), hypertension, myopia, other, and normal** categories from fundus images.
- Enhancing the visibility of pathological findings through image preprocessing techniques.
- Improving the detection of small and localized abnormalities by integrating **attention mechanisms** into deep learning architectures.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **ODIR-5K (Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition)** dataset was used.
- **10,000 fundus images** from 5,000 patients (right/left eye).
- Classes:
  - `Normal`
  - `Diabetic`
  - `Glaucoma`
  - `Cataract`
  - `Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)`
  - `Hypertension`
  - `Myopia`
  - `Other`
